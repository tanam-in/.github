# Tanam.in
During this pandemic, people are required to find other hobbies that don't require them to interact with people or go to public places. Farming is a hobby that is starting to trend during this pandemic, but not everyone has broad insight into farming and tends to be confused about where to start. Tanam.in is an educational application to help plant lovers as well as ordinary people to improve their farming experience. Tanam.in started from the emergence of a problem where the lack of education for plant lovers and ordinary people caused some of them to experience confusion when they wanted to plant and care for plants so they could get good results. After analyzing these problems, we found several questions that we will answer through this project which consist of how to educate the public about the field of farming through a mobile platform, how to maintain the quality of farming results and also how to treat plants if they are exposed to pests or diseases, as well as information on drugs and fertilizers needed. Through this Tanam.in project, our group wants to create a society that is educated in farming and capable of being self-sufficient in terms of food.
